The food, the art, the architecture, the nature, the people – the reasons I’ve fallen in love with Italia are numerous and never-ending. These are just some of my favourite places, and experiences in Italy summed up in a few minutes – here’s to when we can explore this magical country again soon!",

A few years later, I returned with friends for a party weekend – this time noticing even more of the splendour of the city, even if through hazy beer eyes. On my third visit, when my best friend moved there to teach I realised I had no idea what the Czech Republic was like outside of this magnificent city, so I squeeze a few side-trips into my visit.",

With my third visit already being planned out, I think it’s time I put pen to paper on all the reasons to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina, and why this Balkan country really deserves a lot more attention. With under a million visitors a year it’s madness to me this incredible hidden gem in Europe is one of the least visited countries on the continent when, in my opinion, it’s one of the best places on earth.",
