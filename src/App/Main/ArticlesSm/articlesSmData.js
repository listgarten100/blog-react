        body: "Is London the best city break in the world? It’s undoubtedly one of those cities that has a never-ending list of attractions to visit, quirky things to do, and new restaurant openings. I called London home for much of my adult life, and even after many years living there, I still had so many things left to do on my London bucket-list. My real appreciation for London didn’t begin though until I become a tourist. Coming back to a city you once called home with more time (and money) means you can start to appreciate a whole other side to a place. After my two day trip to Manchester, I jumped on a quick train to the capital to start working through my London bucket-list.",

A little breeze gently forced a rose garden to sway, and the bold pillars of a soviet building stood strong on my peripheral.",

The scents, the architecture, the energy; Istanbul is a city that takes you on a whirlwind tour of your senses. Now, even after returning to this incredible city for return visits, and many times passing through with Turkish Airlines, it’s still a city that captures my imagination beyond words.",
